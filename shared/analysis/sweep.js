/* Parameter sweeps — every combination of a set of ranges, and how to rank them.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic over plain objects: no bars, no engine, no clock. The runner
 * that actually executes a sweep lives in `electron/engine/`, because it needs
 * both; everything here can be checked without either.
 *
 * Why the counting is done up front
 * ---------------------------------
 * Ranges multiply. Three settings with twenty values each is eight thousand
 * runs, and on a year of 5-minute bars that is hours — a number nobody guesses
 * correctly from looking at three input fields. `countCombinations` exists so
 * the UI can say what it is about to cost before anyone waits for it.
 *
 * Floating point is the other trap. A range from 1.2 to 3 in steps of 0.1,
 * walked by repeated addition, arrives at 1.9000000000000001 and then stores
 * that as a parameter — so two sweeps that should be identical are not, and a
 * stored result reads as noise. Every value here is computed as
 * `from + index * step` and rounded to the decimals the step itself carries,
 * so the tenth step of 0.1 is exactly 1.0.
 *
 * Ranking, and why expectancy
 * ---------------------------
 * `expectancy` — net profit per trade — is the default because it asks whether
 * the *rule* is worth anything, independently of how often it fired or how
 * large the positions were. Net profit rewards whatever traded most with the
 * most leverage; profit factor ignores how rare the trades were.
 *
 * None of the three is safe on its own, which is what `minTrades` is for: a
 * combination with four trades can top any of them by luck, and reporting it
 * as the best would be the sweep lying about what it found.
 */

/**
 * The most combinations a sweep may expand to.
 *
 * Not a performance budget — it cannot be, because what a combination costs
 * depends entirely on which parameter is being varied. Changing the
 * reward-to-risk reuses the detection and takes milliseconds; changing the
 * minimum gap size forces a fresh one and takes seconds on a year of 5-minute
 * bars. A hundred thousand of the first kind is minutes, a hundred thousand of
 * the second is days.
 *
 * So this is a guard against a slip, not against ambition: a step of 0.001
 * where 0.1 was meant expands to millions, and that is worth refusing before
 * anything starts. Judging the cost is `detectionCount`'s job, and the panel
 * shows it next to this number.
