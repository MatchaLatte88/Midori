/* Running every combination of a sweep, and checking the winners.
 *
 * Deliberately free of worker plumbing: the loop takes a progress callback and
 * a "should I stop" callback, so it runs the same way inside a worker thread,
 * inside a test, and from a script. `sweepWorker.js` is the thin wrapper that
 * gives it a thread; nothing in here knows that thread exists.
 *
 * Two stretches, and why
 * ----------------------
 * A sweep is a machine for overfitting. Try a thousand combinations on one set
 * of bars, keep the best, and what you have found is the combination that
 * memorised those bars — it will look excellent and mean nothing.
 *
 * So the range is split. Every combination runs on the earlier stretch, and
 * only the handful that are actually going to be shown are re-run on the later
 * one, which had no say in choosing them. Two numbers per combination, and the
 * gap between them is the finding: a setting whose out-of-sample result
 * collapses was fitted to noise, and a sweep that reported only the first
 * number would have hidden that.
 *
 * Re-running only the shown ones is a deliberate economy. Checking all 1,615
 * would double the cost of the sweep to produce numbers for combinations
 * nobody will look at.
 *
 * What makes this affordable
 * --------------------------
 * One indicator cache per stretch. On a year of BTC 5m the detection is
 * essentially the whole cost of a run, and parameters like the reward-to-risk
 * do not change what was detected — only what the strategy does about it. A
 * sweep of nineteen reward levels therefore detects once, not nineteen times.
 * The cache is per stretch because it is keyed by parameters and not by bars:
 * sharing one between train and test would report the training period's
 * setups against the test period's bars.
